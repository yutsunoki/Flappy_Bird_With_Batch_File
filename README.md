## Introduction
This is my practice and research how the batch file usage.<br>

## About the command prompt and batch file
Command prompt is a terminal that using instruction to interact with operating system.
The instruction and command can be refer by using a help command,

So, I organized these common useful operator to improve the efficiency of batch script.
